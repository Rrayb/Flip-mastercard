# Master Card --- 3D Rotating Card (Advanced Version)

## Description

This project is an advanced version of a fully animated bank card built
with HTML and CSS.\
Unlike the first project (classic Mastercard design), this version
introduces:

-   a more detailed and modern UI,
-   a realistic **3D rotation effect** on hover,
-   fully designed **front and back faces**,
-   visual elements such as the logo, chip, magnetic strip, and
    signature area.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate a fully stylized, animated,
and realistic bank card using only HTML and CSS.

## Features

-   3D flip animation using `transform: rotateY(180deg)`
-   Separate front and back card faces
-   Modern visual design (glass effect, gradients, shadows)
-   Google Fonts integration (Poppins)
-   Clean and modular HTML/CSS structure

## File Structure

-   `index.html` --- main structure of the card
-   `style.css` --- complete styling and animation logic
-   `image/` --- folder containing all required images

Expected assets: - `image/Mastercard-logo-svg.webp` -
`image/golden-sim-chip-card-microchip-for-payment-or-credit-card-vector.jpg`

## How to Run

1.  Download or clone the project folder.
2.  Place the images in the `image/` directory.
3.  Make sure `index.html` and `style.css` are in the same directory.
4.  Open `index.html` in a browser (or use VS Code with Live Server).

## Customization

-   **Edit the card number, name, or expiration date** directly in
    `index.html`.
-   **Change the background or colors** in `style.css`.
-   **Modify the animation** by adjusting transitions in the
    `.container` CSS rules.

## Improvements to Consider

-   Make the card fully responsive on small screens.
-   Add a click-based flip instead of hover.
-   Add JavaScript to dynamically generate card information.
